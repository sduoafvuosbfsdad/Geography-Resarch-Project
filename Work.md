## Data Analysis
### Question 1 - What attracted you to Singapore?
<img src = 'Qn1.png' alt = 'The graph for Question 1.'>
As shown in the graph, Tourism/Sightseeing is the most cited reason, showing that Singapore is very popular amongst
tourists for its environment and tourist services. The second-highest ranking, Business/Work suggests that Singapore, 
MBS areas is a very popular location for business activities too, apart from it being a tourist destination. This could
also be because it is relatively close to the CBD area where many international companies have their offices located. 
The cultural and social appeal of Singapore is also a significant pull factor that incentivise tourists to come to 
Singapore. 

From the above observations, we can find out more about their purpose in Singapore, and therefore tell if they are just
came to MBS specifically for its tourist destinations or just because it is convenient. In this case, the ratio of the 
amount of people at have chosen tourism/leisure to others (16:14) shows that the people came to MBS specifically for its
awesome tourist destinations.

### Question 2 - What is your purpose of visit?
